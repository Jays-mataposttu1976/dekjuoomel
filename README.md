Wow, Thudarum. My mind's all tangled up like spaghetti. The theater was like a carnival, people chomping popcorn while I’m here, back aching from those rock hard seats. Feels like the   ate my brain and spit it out in tiny colorful pieces that don’t fit back together. I mean, the opening scene alone — it’s like they pulled a rabbit out of a hat but the rabbit was a bear? Just straight bonkers.

> Who was that guy? The one with the eyepatch, looked like he stepped out of a pirate   but he’s really a cool 𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬er? I swear I saw that in another   but it felt like a new flavor of déjà vu. Oh and the coffee shop chase scene — I felt like my heart was a drum solo, bam-bam-bam, but then someone spilled Coke down my shoe. Reality somehow even messier than the screen.

Feels like I’m still hearing echoes of that techno soundtrack in my head, between my thoughts yelling at me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and actually 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ...wasn't there a parrot that talked about quantum physics halfway through? Maybe I'm just melting into my seat, hallucinating. Popcorn crumbs everywhere, like I've been defeated in a crunchy embarrassing battle.

What was the deal with the dream sequences...like being trapped in a washing machine with a broken snorkel. And yet, sometimes, it reminds me of that time when I made a perfect mojito but forgot the mint. Surreal but keeps you thirsty. Did I fall asleep? I might have missed the gorilla on a unicycle scene or maybe that was the trailer. Nothing’s clear, brain's all jittery like I’ve had 5 cups of espresso but it's that feeling when you know you’ve had too much but can’t stop.

Suddenly, mid-climax, I remembered you telling me, 'hey, don't forget to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later' and then someone waved a churro in my face, totally derailing the entire thought train.

Anyway... I’m still here, feeling all upside down. Did it make sense? Did it need to? Ah, I dunno, something about leaving the theater under the fluorescent lights feels like waking from a dream mid-story.
